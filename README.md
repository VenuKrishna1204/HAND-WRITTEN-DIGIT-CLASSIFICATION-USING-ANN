Step 1: Load the Dataset
Use the MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Step 2: Preprocess the Data
Normalize pixel values to a range of 0 to 1.
Flatten the 28x28 images into a single 784-dimensional vector for input into the neural network.
Convert class labels (digits 0-9) into one-hot encoded format for classification.
Step 3: Build the Neural Network Model
Define an input layer with 784 neurons (one per pixel).
Add hidden layers with activation functions like ReLU.
Use a softmax output layer with 10 neurons (one per digit).
Step 4: Compile the Model
Choose an optimizer such as Adam.
Use a loss function like categorical cross-entropy for multi-class classification.
Track accuracy as the evaluation metric.
Step 5: Train the Model
Feed the training data into the model in batches.
Use multiple epochs to improve accuracy.
Monitor loss and accuracy to ensure proper training.
Step 6: Evaluate the Model
Test the trained model on unseen test data.
Measure accuracy and loss.
Identify potential misclassifications.
Step 7: Make Predictions
Input a new digit image.
The model predicts the digit with the highest probability.
Step 8: Optimize and Improve
Tune hyperparameters (number of layers, neurons, learning rate).
Use techniques like dropout to prevent overfitting.
Experiment with deeper networks for better accuracy.
